Saathi = """
Saathi is an initiative of IIT Madras to guide you through your days here. As the name suggests, it is a body of senior student pals and friendly faculty who will always be willing to help you in any matter. Its objectives include achieving overall well-being of the entire student community by equipping and enhancing the all-round skills needed to succeed on campus and in life.

For example, a program aimed solely at improving English language skills, named 'English Minglish,' was launched previously whereby students comfortable only in their vernacular language could converse in English. The other important objective of Saathi is to break the stigma around various issues regarding mental health.

You will be introduced to a Student Mentorship Cell (SMC) mentor, a responsible senior student, who will meet you soon after your arrival at IIT Madras. Besides being your first friend on campus, your mentor can clarify your doubts related to various aspects of institute life.

We wish that you have the most wonderful and fruitful years of your life in the institute and hope that you scale great heights in your career.

Saarang = """
IIT Madras has seen a 60-year journey marked by many milestones, one of which was the advent of Mardi Gras, a pioneer student cultural extravaganza. Mardi Gras had the distinction of hosting Uriah Heep (in one of their rare world tours), Buddha’s Babies and even A R Rahman as a college student. Almost 45 years later, the legacy lives on, but now known as Saarang.

One of the largest cultural festivals in India, Saarang attracts over 50,000 people from around the country. Held in January every year, Saarang is commonly acknowledged as the mother of all cultural festivals, a reputation that the Institute is honour-bound to uphold.

This five-day festival is the traditional meeting place for the young and the young at heart. Saarang is characterised by jam-packed days of events and competitions. Be it the theatre arts, musical displays such as Decibels or the laugh-out-loud wackiness of extempore and Just-A-minute, Saarang always has the crowds screaming for more.

The mainstay of Saarang has always been the five professional shows. Past editions have seen performances by prominent classical artists such as Balamurli Krishna, Ustad Bismillah Khan and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, as well as international bands such as Opeth, Anathema, Architects and Skidrow. Saarang has also played host to light music shows by Shaan, S.P.Balasubramanian, Shankar Ehsaan Loy, Karthik, KK, Benny Dayal, Lucky Ali, Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, Sunidhi Chauhan and Vishal-Shekhar.

Established in 2000, Shaastra held its 20th edition this year. The completely student-run techno-managerial festival stretches over four days and nights in the first week of January. The fest holds the distinction of being the first student-managed event in the world to implement a Quality Management System and earn the ISO 9001:2000 certification. This has since been upgraded twice to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 9001:2015 certifications – a testament to the impeccable standards of the festival over the years.

Shaastra has always been a tremendous learning experience for the organisers, participants and visitors. The fest attracts an immense number of participants from diverse technical, scientific and managerial backgrounds, from school students to graduates, academicians to professionals, engineers to entrepreneurs. Shaastra also has something to offer to non-hardcore techies, with events such as drone wars, laser shows and firework displays that make up a huge part of the Shows and Exhibitions every year.

Shaastra’s intense competitions, lectures and a variety of informative workshops all form a platform to showcase knowledge and enthusiasm.

The Research Expo is a great stage for students and researchers across the nation to showcase their groundbreaking research, while The Summit at Shaastra gives students the opportunity to display their solutions to society's most pressing problems. Meanwhile, Shaastra Solutions is an initiative that aims to bridge the gap between universities and industries by outsourcing problems and assignments faced by companies to undergraduate students across India.

IIT Madras hosts Shaastra, an annual technical event. True to its name, Shaastra—the Sanskrit word for science—is a celebration of free thought and a devotion to the engineering spirit. It offers the chance to get a glimpse of the most cutting-edge technology that is currently popular all over the world and is a melting pot of several scientific disciplines. For the organizers and participants from various technical, scientific, and management backgrounds, Shaastra has always been a very beneficial learning experience. There is something for everyone, from schoolchildren to university grads, academics to businesspeople, and engineers to entrepreneurs. People who aren't ardent technophiles can benefit from Shaastra as well. The fact that Drone Wars, Laser Shows, Fireworks displays, and other events are regularly included in Shows and Exhibitions shows that one need not always be an expert to appreciate what science is capable of. Intense competitions, lectures, and a variety of educational courses provided by Shaastra provide a stage for participants to demonstrate their knowledge and enthusiasm. Watch out for competitions that put contestants' mettle to the absolute limit, such as Fire and Ice, Shaastra Junior Quiz, RoboWars, BrandWars, Hackathons, and others.

TechSoc = """
What I cannot build, I do not understand.
We fight. We build. We win. And eat pizza.

In 2007, a small group of highly ardent IIT Madras students formed a team to inspire the creation of competent technology solutions to solve society's most pressing problems through a set of competitions and events.

Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

Very simply put, Tech-Soc was first born as a tournament where hostels could compete against each other in all tech-related events for points, power, and glory. Tech-Soc was founded in 2005 and has since grown steadily, adding events to its repertoire every year. Together with Schroeter and Lit Soc, it forms the three independent "Big" trophies that hostels compete for every year. Tech Soc is being re-envisioned as a forum with a much wider reach than just inter-hostel events. It has now become the umbrella under which all tech-related student initiatives will be encouraged and nurtured. In the odd semester, various informal sessions like "Fundae" and Tech interaction sessions will also be organized so that the freshmen can learn about the tech world they are about to enter. Apart from these, one can join various clubs related to the technical world.

We always have something going on for the tech-savvy. You get to dirty your hands and build stuff on your own or participate in tech quizzes or watch the spectacle as the different hostels battle it out in Tech Soc.

Scoring System
⭐ NOTE: The participants' hostel will be the one they are currently residing in this semester. For example, for Cauvery residents, while virtual allocation might say something else, since they are residing in Cauvery for the July-November 2022 semester, they will be representing Cauvery.

The Inter Hostel Events of IIT Madras are divided into 4 categories - Low Prep, No Prep, Mid Prep, and High Prep:

Event Difficulty - Meaning
No Prep - No preparation required from participants' side. Event is on-spot and will be over within 2-3 hours.
Low Prep - 1-5 days of work required from participants.
Mid Prep - 6-12 days of work required from participants.
High Prep - 12+ days of work required from participants.

Points are awarded to any participating team from any hostel for 3 reasons - Winning Points (decided as per event difficulty), Parti Points, and Brownie Points.

NOTE: While the total points for each event category shall be retained, the points breakdown may change as per the event difficulty level. For example, in an event where submission itself is a difficult task, the variance between winning points awarded for different positions will change.

Parti Points - These points shall be awarded to any "parti"-cipating team/individual representing the hostel.

We have defined a "normalization factor" (N.F.) to ensure an equitable distribution of points as per hostel strength. This is done to ensure that a similar participation percent from different hostel strengths is awarded equally.

Normalization factor = Number of participants from hostel / Hostel strength

Total Participation Score = Normalization Factor * Event Difficulty Constant

For different levels of event difficulty, different constants will be set.

Brownie Points - These points shall be awarded for a team/individual that did not get a podium finish but displayed exemplary performance. This will be at the discretion of the organizing club. More than 1 team can be awarded different values of brownie points.

Sports = """

Sporting at IIT Madras is not merely an activity. It has, over the years, gained so much ground that it finds itself ingrained in the IITM culture. The level of enthusiasm this sporting culture generates extends beyond the campus walls; it's a source of an adrenaline rush for other colleges in the city and the country as well. The academic calendar is crowded with sporting events, including intra-hostel and inter-hostel events, as well as inter-collegiate and inter-IIT tournaments. All the hostels actively compete to win the coveted Schroeter Cup, which is the Inter-Hostel Sports Championship. In addition to all these, we've added a couple of surprises for you this year! The institute has excellent sporting facilities on the campus, which include:

1. K.S. Narayanan Center for Cricketing Excellence

A General Championship (GC) is awarded to the team with the best performance in both the events. The seven old IITs take turns, hosting the Meet in all splendor. This fierce competition for pride, prestige, and glory equally embraces a great spirit of sportsmanship, which marks these moments as the most cherished memories of an IITian's life. The Meet is perhaps the only event that provides an opportunity to meet and interact with students from the other IITs. IIT Madras has had its major share of glory, excelling continually at these games and winning the General Championship (GC) eleven times in a row in the past. With over 19 wins in 51 Inter IIT Sports Meets so far, IIT Madras has propounded itself as an unstoppable force in the history of the games, thanks to the brilliant performance from the students.

Ragging = """
Ragging must be a word that is bothering you at the back of your mind. Well, at the outset, let us inform you that the practice of ragging is not condoned by the institute in any form. If you have any problems regarding this, please feel free to contact your SMC mentor or the hostel warden. Do not let this word alarm you. All you may have would be a small chat with a group of seniors, who would crack a joke or two, with the intention of easing the air around and to break the ice. This friendly conversation has always ended up in leaving both the parties close to each other. For the seniors, it is the time to get rid of unwanted books. For the juniors, it is an hour or two well spent getting to know the ropes. Nothing more, nothing less. We empathize in case you feel uncomfortable and are always free to let them know or leave the place. Also, please let your mentor know if someone is not abiding by the above.
"""

Gender Sensation = """
Sincere efforts have been made to ensure gender equality on campus. Just as the Government of India has devised many legal provisions to ensure the safety and dignity of all genders, IIT Madras too, earnestly strives to create an environment of freedom, autonomy, and privacy with the help of its students, faculty, and staff. People of all genders on campus are entitled to all legal and fundamental rights and a safe, dignified and conducive environment where they can be trained for their professional careers and to realize their full potential as individuals. While many measures are taken to ensure safety on campus, it’s possible to face gender-based discrimination everywhere, and we at IITM recognize that the first step is to speak openly about such issues. As such, it is everyone’s duty to be aware of the rules and rights in such a scenario. Sexual harassment is NOT tolerated on campus, and every individual must be careful about not indulging in such behavior. Preethi Aghalayam, the Women’s Forum with female faculty as members, works with CCASH to provide gender sensitization and awareness through talks, events, discussions, etc.
"""

Insti_Lingo = """
A few minutes into the campus, you will encounter students conversing among themselves in a tongue which comes across as plain gibberish. Welcome to IIT Madras! The IIT Madras lingo has words extending beyond the realm of the bulkiest Oxford Dictionary or the most exhaustive Websters. Students at IITM, over the years, have developed their own indigenous vocabulary which symbolizes the two traits of an IITian demarcating him from the average guy next door: Creativity and Brevity. In this age of time management gurus and their techniques, our lingo stands out as a wonderful example of concision. Infact, there is a thesis written on the lingo used at IIT Madras. (We kid you not!) For more on Insti lingo, look out for T5E’s web series dedicated to freshies! Or check it out on Mitr App.
"""

Electives = """
At IIT Madras, students have the freedom to select 50% of their course offerings. This includes the option of spending the entire semester studying abroad and pursuing electives from any department.

Even among the IITs, Indian Institute of Technology Madras boasts one of the greatest academic curriculum available and provides unparalleled academic flexibility. The Ministry of Education, Government of India, has given IIT Madras the remarkable distinction of being the only Indian Institute to have been ranked as the No. 1 Engineering Institution for five consecutive years.

In IIT Madras, students have the freedom to choose nearly 50 per cent of the courses that they will be studying, with only some restrictions. Out of the electives, students are free to choose about eight courses (called 'Free Electives') from any of the 16 departments of IIT Madras as well as other approved institutions. The students can get 72 credits from pursuing courses as diverse as 'History of India,' 'Psychology,' and 'Economics' to 'Artificial intelligence' and 'Machine Learning.'

How to choose courses in IITs?

If a student chooses four such courses in one contiguous area, they will be conferred a minor in that field. For example, if a student chooses four courses in Economics, IIT Madras will confer a Minor in Economics to that student. There are large numbers of minor courses being offered by IIT Madras.

The detailed curriculum and syllabus for each program can be found here.
"""

Honours_programme = """
To obtain an honours degree, students will have to maintain a CPA greater than or equal to 8.5, complete a 27-credit project (wherein one is expected to put in 27 hours of work every week throughout the 16-week semester) and earn at least 18 of the free elective credits in their parent department. The program, however, is open to only BTech and Dual Degree students.
"""

Hostel = """ 
The hostels are located sufficiently far from the departments. There are around 21 hostels, out of which five are girls’ hostels and all are named after various Indian rivers. In order not to disturb the greenery and to maintain the ecological balance, though we have a vast campus with places spread out, students are not allowed to drive powered vehicles on the campus. They can only use bicycles or walk. The institute operates buses and vans from the main gate to different parts of the campus and around Hostel and Academic zones at frequent intervals for easy travel. The first-year undergraduate students will be accommodated in a double/triple occupancy style accommodation; in subsequent years, single rooms are allotted. PG students are given single rooms. Internet and Local Area Network (LAN) facilities are provided in every room and there is a computer room in the hostels as well. You will also be given an email account on the institute server.

It is expected that the residents of the hostels shall follow the rules and regulations, violation of which will lead to appropriate disciplinary action. A copy of the rules and regulations document is available at https://ccw.iitm.ac.in/. Please go through this important document carefully, especially the code of conduct.

Campus = """
The magnificent IITM campus is spread over an area of 617 acres with multiple facilities like those enlisted below:

1. Central library - apart from the department libraries, we have a 5-floor Central Library near Gajendra Circle. The biggest reason why people visit here is to fight the humid weather of Chennai along with unlimited WiFi. It has lakhs of books which can be read there itself or borrowed out by the insti ID card.

2. Students' Activity Center is a top player in the category student Activities in the IIT Madras. From regular badminton, cultural activities, co-curricular activities are the biggest crown-holding events that happen here with the capacity of more than 3000+.

Student_governance = """
In India, there are very few colleges that offer a supportive environment where students can express their concerns and thoughts. But IIT Madras is distinct from other universities. The respect accorded to student voices, which has been codified in the form of the Students Constitution, is one distinct feature of our institute that distinguishes it from other colleges. An outline of student governance in general, including its elements and roles, is provided here.

Student Legislative Council & Executive Council

The student legislative council is also tasked with assisting the offices of the deans of students, academic courses, academic research, and international & alumni affairs in running day-to-day student matters through the Executive council. The Student Governance process of our Institute is most prominently represented by the Executive Wing, which is made up of student representatives who are directly elected by the General Student Body.

T5E = """
T5E, or The Fifth Estate, is IIT Madras’s official campus news and media body. Established relatively recently in 2009, T5E is responsible for reporting on campus events and activities and also bringing out content on a wide range of issues relevant to the IIT Madras community, be it students (prospective or current), parents, faculty, or staff. In the last few years, T5E has expanded drastically in terms of outreach and content, and made a name for itself in the institute. One of its main distinguishing features is that it remains neutral and unbiased both in its coverage and internal functioning, having prided itself on working in a transparent and accountable manner.

In 2002, The Fourth Estate or TFE came into being to bring together the institute’s literary talents on a common platform to write about institute events and activities. This institute magazine covered essays, opinion pieces, news, and fiction.

On campus, there are three temples:
The Shree Durga Peeli Amman Temple (Processions take place at the Shree Durga Peeli Amman Temple on Delhi Avenue during Navratri).
The Jalakandeswarar Temple (Mahashivaratri and other celebrations, as well as sporadic classical artist performances, are held in the Jalakandeswarar Temple next to the Adyar Gate).
The Vinayagar Temple (Celebrations for Ganesh Chaturthi and Saraswati Pooja take place at the Vinayagar Temple, located behind Taramani Guest House).

On Sunday mornings, it is simple to find the chapel behind the Department of Biotechnology by listening to the sound of the choir. The chapel, which just celebrated its sixth birthday, holds Mass and other events like "intercession of prayers," in which members receive handwritten, anonymous petitions and subsequently pray for the recipient. Catholic Mass is held every Sunday at 8:30 am in the NCC building in addition to the chapel; the community also frequently participates in charitable work, visits to orphanages, and other activities.

There is a prayer hall for Islamic Students, located behind the Students Facilities Centre, near the Himalaya Mess, where people offer prayers regularly. The Friday sermon is conducted in English. Besides this, the community organizes activities and classes for members of the Islamic faith, such as the recitation of the Quran and more.

SABHAS AND SAMITIS
There are a lot of regional clubs on campus that organize cultural events, get-togethers, and meals throughout the year. Regional club members include not only students, but also faculty and staff. In the first year, they are a great way to make new friends and keep homesickness at bay, so watch out for notices on campus announcing their events, especially for freshers. The regional clubs on campus include:

Hindi Mitra Mandal (HMM)
Hindi Mitra Mandal is a group of enthusiastic students who celebrate the diversity of our country. We have a good history of organizing Festivals, cultural programs, and joyful events like Holi Celebration, Krishna Janmashtami, Diwali, and Navratri in our institute.

MARATHI MITRA MANDAL
Marathi Mitra Mandal is an Institute-recognized, a student-driven body coming under the various regional Samitis on the campus. There are more than 300 students coming from all over Maharashtra for various programs, and the organization aims at keeping the Marathi culture and spirit alive on the campus through various events and festivals, celebrated with great pomp in Maharashtra. Notable events conducted include Ganesh Chaturthi, Dahi Handi, a musical event Indradhanu in the odd semester, and a drama event Snehabandha in the even semester.

GARVI GUJARATI SANGATHAN
Garvi Gujarati Sangathan is a body of Gujarati students on our campus. It has been formed with a view to provide a platform for Gujarati students on the campus to know, meet, and bond with each other. GGS also aims to celebrate the cultural festivals which are prominent in Gujarat like Navratri, Shivratri, Janmashtami, and more, giving us a chance to enjoy and cherish the festivals and culture here away from home.

SADINER (Students Association for Development of India's North East Region)
SADINER is the association of the students coming from the North East region of India which is involved in various social and cultural activities in the campus. Our association has had an active participation in events like Independence Day, Republic Day, etc in the institute as well as played an active role in social activities like organizing flood relief funds for the North Eastern states. Our flagship event is the North East India fest which is organized every year in the Spring Semester.

DIGANTO
Diganto, the Bengali Association of IIT Madras is not only an organization that unites all Bengalis who are part of this institute, but it is more like a family where we meet people speaking our native language and share the same culture that brings us the essence of being at home in Chennai.

KARKA KASADARA TAMIL CLUB
The objectives of the club provide and maintain social, academic, and recreational amenities for its Tamil members and to teach Tamil to non-natives, to acquaint them with the language and its culture as well as to conduct training and workshops by teachers of foreign languages and Tamil, to both the non-native and the native audience.

TELUGU SAMSKRITIKA SAMITHI
Telugu Samskritika Samithi is a group of enthusiastic students who celebrate the Telugu cultural diversity of our country. They organize Festivals, cultural programs, and celebrate events like Vinayaka Chathurthi, Krishna Janmashtami, Rama Navami in our institute.

KERALA KALA SAMITHI (KKS)
KKS was initiated decades ago and grown with the support of faculty and students. The precious legacies, powerful aspects of language, poetry, drama, dance, Mohiniattam, Kathakali, and so on chiefly based in Kerala, are really fascinating and it will be of immense individual and collective advantage to arrange for sharing the experience and insights of the population from one region with those of the neighbors, structured on a sober platform of long-cherished ethic through this platform.

WiFi_LAN = """
LAN is available in every room of all Hostels. Students have to bring their own LAN cable to connect it to their Laptop/PC. And Wi-Fi is available in Academic Section, In Library and many more places.

For connecting to Wi-Fi, you just have to select iitmwifi in the Wi-Fi option on your device and connect it through your roll number and LDAP Password.

General Instruction to connect LAN:

Firstly, we have to do Remote Proxy Setup.
Remote Proxy Setup:
If you require access to workflow.iitm.ac.in, academic.iitm.ac.in, or other internal websites OR journals available through IITM subscription, other restricted websites available only through IITM network and do not otherwise need access to licenses or servers inside IIT Madras, please use the following proxy setup instead of VPN. Instructions are given here for Firefox only - for Chrome or Internet Explorer/Edge, you will need to see how to set up the proxy options. Also, the instructions here are only for the desktop, so please give feedback if you know how to make it work for mobile browsers.

Step 1: Open the “Preferences” page in Firefox.
Step 2: Open the “Network Settings” page under the Preferences (search for “proxy” should do it).
Step 3: Set the Proxy Auto-Config URL and reload if necessary.
Step 4: Log in with LDAP credentials (not ADS).

Effect:
Once the above steps are done, you should find that only traffic destined for workflow, academic, journals, etc., goes through the proxy, and everything else goes through your regular network. For any issues, mail to helpdeskcc@iitm.ac.in.
"""

FacAd = """
Faculty advisors are professors assigned to a group of students, often by roll number basis, whose task is to assist one throughout their stay in IIT Madras with any academic or other help they may require. Whether it entails settling in a hostel, feeling homesick, having concerns about certain procedures, or needing academic advice, there is nothing that isn’t within the spectrum of acceptable issues to approach your faculty advisor with. They will simply refer you to the concerned person/body if they feel that the matter is out of their jurisdiction to solve. Most professors ensure regular meetings with their assigned students to stay in the loop; others may not. It is therefore important to make yourself known to your respective advisors, in order to avoid being stared at dubiously and then asked who you are if, on the off chance, you decide to finally approach them for help after two years of never having met them. In some cases, there is a round of introduction of faculty advisors during the respective department orientations, so it is advisable to pay attention.
"""

Websites = """
courses@iitm.ac.in:
This is the main academic website that gives you a list of all your courses and the teachers that teach you those courses. It is the all-in-one academic platform where you’ll be given assignments and additional course material. All your quiz papers, tutorials, and solutions will be uploaded on your personal account. In fact, some professors even prefer taking quizzes through this. The website has an app version called Moodle which is a must-download. You can log in to Moodle using your L-DAP credentials, which is basically your roll number as your login ID and a unique password. ‘Uploading on Moodle’ is a term that you’re going to hear very often throughout your insti life.

workflow@iitm.ac.in:
Workflow IITM is the website that you’ll be using to register for all your courses officially. During the add-and-drop courses week, you can register and deregister courses if approved by your faculty advisor. Workflow can only be accessed by logging into netaccess.iitm.ac.in through your L-DAP credentials or using institute WiFi.

"""

NSO_NCA_NSS_NCC = """
Talking to freshies, I am reminded of the same awe and bewilderment with which I navigated my first few weeks of insti life. And naturally, one of the biggest conundrums we faced back then was choosing one of NSO, NSS, NCC, or NCA. This article hopes to throw some light on the specifics of each so as to aid freshies in their decision-making process.

NCC (National Cadet Corps):

This is the most underrated of the available options owing to the various myths that cast it in a strict, cruel, and monotonous light. No surprise there, since NCC is known for its parade drills and working hours that will make you wake up at dawn-break. But the battalion in insti happens to be an air force tech squadron, which means that there is less focus on drill and more on other technical and practical aspects of flying. In fact, drill practices are held only for stretches of about a week right before the Independence and Republic Day celebrations. In the rest of the meetings that are held every week, the cadets are given fitness training and might indulge in a spectrum of activities from learning to fly drones to even watching movies about flying. These sessions usually last a couple of hours starting at 6 in the morning.

NSS (National Service Scheme):

NSS is an excellent opportunity for students to step out of the comfort of their everyday life and engage in social service. With its wide range of projects targeting different sections of the population, NSS has over the years made significant contributions to the society. Its projects can be broadly classified into teaching projects, awareness projects, and content generation projects.

NSO (National Sports Organization):

NSO is the most popular option among students. No surprise there. Don’t we all love a good game? NSO offers the option of choosing from a variety of sports spanning cricket, athletics, frisbee, yoga, weightlifting, aquatics to name a few. The entire list can be found in the smail regarding the same.

NCA (National Cultural Appreciation):

This is the newest addition to the list, having started the year before. This is a great opportunity for students to hone their skill in a cultural activity of their choice or even learn an entirely new skill. Roughly 100-120 selections are in place.

Now that you have a fairly good idea of each of NSO, NCC, NSS, and NCA, I would like to take this opportunity to address another question frequently asked by most freshies.

You don’t have to worry about being left without being selected in anything. There are exactly as many vacancies as there are freshmen.

So, at the end, all those students who’ve been selected in more than one of NSO, NCC, etc. will have to choose exactly one and drop the rest. The vacancies will be filled by those students who haven’t gotten selected in anything yet.

At the end of the day, no matter what you take, just remember to slay it.
