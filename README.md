# dostE

- Summary of the Problem:
    - The plethora of stuff to explore at IITM and the numerous courses to opt for each semester make it difficult for any newbie to handle and choose an option that just suits his/her interests.
    - We aim to build an **AI-powered Large Language Model** (LLM) that’s specially designed to cater for the needs of IITM students wherein the detailed information about each and every PoR, club, activity and course is available at your fingertips and just a brief, casual chatting, can get you enormously scattered information (including the honest **fundaes** from seniors 😉), in a highly **concise and organized** format so that just names brief details are no more misleading.
    - **dostE** can prove to be extremely helpful, especially for freshers who aspire to explore everything at insti as they would now have **‘dost’** to rely upon!!!
- Why the need arises:
    - The need arises due to many opportunities and a lack of a single place or person to approach for the information of all of them.
    - The names and descriptions of PoRs are sometimes misleading; students don’t achieve all they had expected from the same and end up looking for more.
- Objectives (What do you want to achieve):
    - We wish to tackle the above-mentioned problem and create a one-stop solution for all these issues.
    - We aspire for a mechanism that enables anyone to know an opportunity in and out before applying and to pursue their true passion.
- Solution Approach
    - We aim to build an **AI-powered ChatBot - dostE,** specially for IITM students.
    - With dostE, you can access comprehensive information about every Position of Responsibility (PoR), club, activity, and course effortlessly. It enables you to quickly gather a wealth of information, including candid insights from seniors, all presented concisely and well-organised. This ensures that vague or incomplete details are no longer a hindrance.
    - For newcomers to the institute, especially freshmen eager to explore everything it has to offer, **dostE** can be an invaluable resource, providing them with a trusted 'friend' to rely on!!!"
